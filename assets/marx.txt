the manifesto was published as the platform of the communist league a workingmens association first exclusively german later on international and under the political conditions of the continent before 1848 unavoidably a secret society at a congress of the league held in london in november 1847 marx and engels were commissioned to prepare for publication a complete theoretical and practical party programme drawn up in german in january 1848 the manuscript was sent to the printer in london a few weeks before the french revolution of february 24 a french translation was brought out in paris shortly before the insurrection of june 1848 the first english translation by miss helen macfarlane appeared in george julian harneys red republican london 1850 a danish and a polish edition had also been published
the defeat of the parisian insurrection of june 1848—the first great battle between proletariat and bourgeoisie—drove again into the background for a time the social and political aspirations of the european working class thenceforth the struggle for supremacy was again as it had been before the revolution of february solely between the different sections of the propertied class the working class was reduced to a fight for political elbow-room and to the position of extreme wing of the middle-class radicals wherever independent proletarian movements continued to show signs of life they were ruthlessly hunted down thus the prussian police hunted out the central board of the communist league then located in cologne the members were arrested and after eighteen months imprisonment they were tried in october 1852 this celebrated cologne communist trial lasted from october 4 till november 12 seven of the prisoners were sentenced to terms of imprisonment in a fortress varying from three to six years immediately after the sentence the league was formally dissolved by the remaining members as to the manifesto it seemed thenceforth to be doomed to oblivion
when the european working class had recovered sufficient strength for another attack on the ruling classes the international workingmens association sprang up but this association formed with the express aim of welding into one body the whole militant proletariat of europe and america could not at once proclaim the principles laid down in the manifesto the international was bound to have a programme broad enough to be acceptable to the english trades unions to the followers of proudhon in france belgium italy and spain and to the lassalleans in germany marx who drew up this programme to the satisfaction of all parties entirely trusted to the intellectual development of the working class which was sure to result from combined action and mutual discussion the very events and vicissitudes of the struggle against capital the defeats even more than the victories could not help bringing home to mens minds the insufficiency of their various favorite nostrums and preparing the way for a more complete insight into the true conditions of working-class emancipation and marx was right the international on its breaking up in 1874 left the workers quite different men from what it had found them in 1864 proudhonism in france lassalleanism in germany were dying out and even the conservative english trades unions though most of them had long since severed their connection with the international were gradually advancing towards that point at which last year at swansea their president could say in their name continental socialism has lost its terrors for us in fact the principles of the manifesto had made considerable headway among the workingmen of all countries
the manifesto itself thus came to the front again the german text had been since 1850 reprinted several times in switzerland england and america in 1872 it was translated into english in new york where the translation was published in woodhull and claflins weekly from this english version a french one was made in le socialiste of new york since then at least two more english translations more or less mutilated have been brought out in america and one of them has been reprinted in england the first russian translation made by bakounine was published at herzens kolokol office in geneva about 1863 a second one by the heroic vera zasulitch also in geneva 1882 a new danish edition is to be found in socialdemokratisk bibliothek copenhagen 1885 a fresh french translation in le socialiste paris 1886 from this latter a spanish version was prepared and published in madrid 1886 the german reprints are not to be counted there have been twelve altogether at the least an armenian translation which was to be published in constantinople some months ago did not see the light i am told because the publisher was afraid of bringing out a book with the name of marx on it while the translator declined to call it his own production of further translations into other languages i have heard but have not seen them thus the history of the manifesto reflects to a great extent the history of the modern working class movement at present it is undoubtedly the most widespread the most international production of all socialist literature the common platform acknowledged by millions of workingmen from siberia to california
yet when it was written we could not have called it a socialist manifesto by socialists in 1847 were understood on the one hand the adherents of the various utopian systems owenites in england fourierists in france both of them already reduced to the position of mere sects and gradually dying out on the other hand the most multifarious social quacks who by all manners of tinkering professed to redress without any danger to capital and profit all sorts of social grievances in both cases men outside the working class movement and looking rather to the educated classes for support whatever portion of the working classes had become convinced of the insufficiency of mere political revolutions and had proclaimed the necessity of a total social change that portion then called itself communist it was a crude rough-hewn purely instinctive sort of communism still it touched the cardinal point and was powerful enough among the working class to produce the utopian communism in france of cabet and in germany of weitling thus socialism was in 1847 a middle class movement communism a working class movement socialism was on the continent at least respectable communism was the very opposite and as our notion from the very beginning was that the emancipation of the working class must be the act of the working class itself there could be no doubt as to which of the two names we must take moreover we have ever since been far from repudiating it
the manifesto being our joint production i consider myself bound to state that the fundamental proposition which forms its nucleus belongs to marx that proposition is that in every historical epoch the prevailing mode of economic production and exchange and the social organization necessarily following from it form the basis upon which is built up and from which alone can be explained the political and intellectual history of that epoch that consequently the whole history of mankind (since the dissolution of primitive tribal society holding land in common ownership) has been a history of class struggles contests between exploiting and exploited ruling and oppressed classes that the history of these class struggles forms a series of evolution in which nowadays a stage has been reached where the exploited and the oppressed class—the proletariat—cannot attain its emancipation from the sway of the exploiting and ruling class—the bourgeoisie—without at the same time and once for all emancipating society at large from all exploitation oppression class distinctions and class struggles
this proposition which in my opinion is destined to do for history what darwins theory has done for biology we both of us had been gradually approaching for some years before 1845 how far i had independently progressed toward it is best shown by my condition of the working class in england but when i again met marx at brussels in the spring of 1845 he had it ready worked out and put it before me in terms almost as clear as those in which i have stated it here
from our joint preface to the german edition of 1872 i quote the following
however much the state of things may have altered during the last twenty-five years the general principles laid down in this manifesto are on the whole as correct to-day as ever here and there some detail might be improved the practical application of the principles will depend as the manifesto itself states everywhere and at all times on the historical conditions for the time being existing and for that reason no special stress is laid on the revolutionary measures proposed at the end of that passage would in many respects be very differently worded to-day in view of the gigantic strides of modern industry since 1848 and of the accompanying improved and extended organization of the working class in view of the practical experience gained first in the february revolution and then still more in the paris commune where the proletariat for the first time held political power for two whole months this programme has in some details become antiquated one thing especially was proved by the commune viz that the working class cannot simply lay hold of the ready-made state machinery and wield it for its own purposes (see the civil war in france address of the general council of the international workingmens association london truelove 1871 p 15 where this point is further developed) further it is self-evident that the criticism of socialist literature is deficient in relation to the present time because it comes down only to 1847 also that the remarks on the relation of the communists to the various opposition parties () although in principle still correct yet in practice are antiquated because the political situation has been entirely changed and the progress of history has swept from off the earth the greater portion of the political parties there enumerated
but then the manifesto has become a historical document which we have no longer any right to alter
the present translation is by mr samuel moore the translator of the greater portion of marxs capital we have revised it and i have added a few notes explanatory of historical allusions

london january 30 1888
lassalle personally to us always acknowledged himself to be a disciple of marx and as such stood on the ground of the manifesto but in his public agitation 1862-64 he did not go beyond demanding co-operative workshops supported by state credit

a specter is haunting europe—the specter of communism all the powers of old europe have entered into a holy alliance to exorcise this specter pope and czar metternich and guizot french radicals and german police spies
where is the party in opposition that has not been decried as communistic by its opponents in power where the opposition that has not hurled back the branding reproach of communism against the more advanced opposition parties as well as against its reactionary adversaries
two things result from this fact
i communism is already acknowledged by all european powers to be in itself a power
it is high time that communists should openly in the face of the whole world publish their views their aims their tendencies and meet this nursery tale of the specter of communism with a manifesto of the party itself
to this end the communists of various nationalities have assembled in london and sketched the following manifesto to be published in the english french german italian flemish and danish languages
i

the history of all hitherto existing society is the history of class struggles
freeman and slave patrician and plebeian lord and serf guildmaster and journeyman in a word oppressor and oppressed stood in constant opposition to one another carried on an uninterrupted now hidden now open fight that each time ended either in the revolutionary reconstitution of society at large or in the common ruin of the contending classes
in the earlier epochs of history we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders a manifold gradation of social rank in ancient rome we have patricians knights plebeians slaves in the middle ages feudal lords vassals guild masters journeymen apprentices serfs in almost all of these classes again subordinate gradations
the modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms it has but established new classes new conditions of oppression new forms of struggle in place of the old ones
our epoch the epoch of the bourgeois possesses however this distinctive feature it has simplified the class antagonisms society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps into two great classes directly facing each other bourgeoisie and proletariat
from the serfs of the middle ages sprang the chartered burghers of the earliest towns from these burgesses the first elements of the bourgeoisie were developed
the discovery of america the rounding of the cape opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie the east indian and chinese markets the colonization of america trade with the colonies the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally gave to commerce to navigation to industry an impulse never before known and thereby to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society a rapid development
the feudal system of industry under which industrial production was monopolized by close guilds now no longer sufficed for the growing wants of the new markets the manufacturing system took its place the guild masters were pushed on one side by the manufacturing middle class division of labor between the different corporate guilds vanished in the face of division of labor in each single workshop
meantime the markets kept ever growing the demand ever rising even manufacture no longer sufficed thereupon steam and machinery revolutionized industrial production the place of manufacture was taken by the giant modern industry the place of the industrial middle class by industrial millionaires the leaders of whole industrial armies the modern bourgeois
modern industry has established the worlds market for which the discovery of america paved the way the market has given an immense development to commerce to navigation to communication by land this development has in its turn reacted on the extension of industry and in proportion as industry commerce navigation and railways extended in the same proportion the bourgeoisie developed increased its capital and pushed into the background every class handed down from the middle ages
we see therefore how the modern bourgeoisie is itself the product of a long course of development of a series of revolutions in the modes of production and of exchange
each step in the development of the bourgeoisie was accompanied by a corresponding political advance of that class an oppressed class under the sway of the feudal nobility an armed and self-governing association in the medieval commune here independent urban republic (as in italy and germany) there taxable third estate of the monarchy (as in france) afterwards in the period of manufacture proper serving either the semi-feudal or the absolute monarchy as a counterpoise against the nobility and in fact corner-stone of the great monarchies in general the bourgeoisie has at last since the establishment of modern industry and of the worlds market conquered for itself in the modern representative state exclusive political sway the executive of the modern state is but a committee for managing the common affairs of the whole bourgeoisie
the bourgeoisie historically has played a most revolutionary part
the bourgeoisie wherever it has got the upper hand has put an end to all feudal patriarchal idyllic relations it has pitilessly torn asunder the motley feudal ties that bound man to his natural superiors and has left remaining no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest callous cash payment it has drowned the most heavenly ecstacies of religious fervor of chivalrous enthusiasm of philistine sentimentalism in the icy water of egotistical calculation it has resolved personal worth into exchange value and in place of the numberless indefeasible chartered freedoms has set up that single unconscionable freedom—free trade in one word for exploitation veiled by religious and political illusions it has substituted naked shameless direct brutal exploitation
the bourgeoisie has stripped of its halo every occupation hitherto honored and looked up to with reverent awe it has converted the physician the lawyer the priest the poet the man of science into its paid wage laborers
the bourgeoisie has torn away from the family its sentimental veil and has reduced the family relation to a mere money relation
the bourgeoisie has disclosed how it came to pass that the brutal display of vigor in the middle ages which reactionists so much admire found its fitting complement in the most slothful indolence it has been the first to show what mans activity can bring about it has accomplished wonders far surpassing egyptian pyramids roman aqueducts and gothic cathedrals it has conducted expeditions that put in the shade all former exoduses of nations and crusades
the bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production and thereby the relations of production and with them the whole relations of society conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered forms was on the contrary the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes constant revolutionizing of production uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions everlasting uncertainty and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones all fixed fast-frozen relations with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions are swept away all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify all that is solid melts into air all that is holy is profaned and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real conditions of life and his relations with his kind
the need of a constantly expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole surface of the globe it must nestle everywhere settle everywhere establish connections everywhere
the bourgeoisie has through its exploitation of the worlds market given a cosmopolitan character to production and consumption in every country to the great chagrin of reactionists it has drawn from under the feet of industry the national ground on which it stood all old-established national industries have been destroyed or are daily being destroyed they are dislodged by new industries whose introduction becomes a life and death question for all civilized nations by industries that no longer work up indigenous raw material but raw material drawn from the remotest zones industries whose products are consumed not only at home but in every quarter of the globe in place of the old wants satisfied by the productions of the country we find new wants requiring for their satisfaction the products of distant lands and climes in place of the old local and national seclusion and self-sufficiency we have intercourse in every direction universal inter-dependence of nations and as in material so also in intellectual production the intellectual creations of individual nations become common property national one-sidedness and narrow-mindedness become more and more impossible and from the numerous national and local literatures there arises a world literature
the bourgeoisie by the rapid improvement of all instruments of production by the immensely facilitated means of communication draws all even the most barbarian nations into civilization the cheap prices of its commodities are the heavy artillery with which it batters down all chinese walls with which it forces the barbarians intensely obstinate hatred of foreigners to capitulate it compels all nations on pain of extinction to adopt the bourgeois mode of production it compels them to introduce what it calls civilization into their midst ie to become bourgeois themselves in one word it creates a world after its own image
the bourgeoisie has subjected the country to the rule of the towns it has created enormous cities has greatly increased the urban population as compared with the rural and has thus rescued a considerable part of the population from the idiocy of rural life just as it has made the country dependent on the towns so it has made barbarian and semi-barbarian countries dependent on the civilized ones nations of peasants on nations of bourgeois the east on the west
the bourgeoisie keeps more and more doing away with the scattered state of the population of the means of production and of property it has agglomerated population centralized means of production and has concentrated property in a few hands the necessary consequence of this was political centralization independent or but loosely connected provinces with separate interests laws governments and systems of taxation became lumped together into one nation with one government one code of laws one national class interest one frontier and one customs tariff
the bourgeoisie during its rule of scarce one hundred years has created more massive and more colossal productive forces than have all preceding generations together subjection of natures forces to man machinery application of chemistry to industry and agriculture steam navigation railways electric telegraphs clearing of whole continents for cultivation canalization of rivers whole populations conjured out of the ground—what earlier century had even a presentiment that such productive forces slumbered in the lap of social labor
we see then the means of production and of exchange on whose foundation the bourgeoisie built itself up were generated in feudal society at a certain stage in the development of these means of production and of exchange the conditions under which feudal society produced and exchanged the feudal organization of agriculture and manufacturing industry in one word the feudal relations of property became no longer compatible with the already developed productive forces they became so many fetters they had to be burst asunder
into their place stepped free competition accompanied by a social and political constitution adapted to it and by the economical and political sway of the bourgeois class
a similar movement is going on before our own eyes modern bourgeois society with its relations of production of exchange and of property a society that has conjured up such gigantic means of production and of exchange is like the sorcerer who is no longer able to control the powers of the nether world whom he has called up by his spells for many a decade past the history of industry and commerce is but the history of the revolt of modern productive forces against modern conditions of production against the property relations that are the conditions for the existence of the bourgeoisie and of its rule it is enough to mention the commercial crises that by their periodical return put on its trial each time more threateningly the existence of the bourgeois society in these crises a great part not only of the existing products but also of the previously created productive forces is periodically destroyed in these crises there breaks out an epidemic that in all earlier epochs would have seemed an absurdity—the epidemic of overproduction society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism it appears as if a famine a universal war of devastation had cut off the supply of every means of subsistence industry and commerce seem to be destroyed and why because there is too much civilization too much means of subsistence too much industry too much commerce the productive forces at the disposal of society no longer tend to further the development of the conditions of bourgeois property on the contrary they have become too powerful for these conditions by which they are fettered and so soon as they overcome these fetters they bring disorder into the whole of bourgeois society endanger the existence of bourgeois property the conditions of bourgeois society are too narrow to comprise the wealth created by them and how does the bourgeoisie get over these crises on the one hand by enforced destruction of a mass of productive forces on the other by the conquest of new markets and by the more thorough exploitation of the old ones that is to say by paving the way for more extensive and more destructive crises and by diminishing the means whereby crises are prevented
the weapons with which the bourgeoisie felled feudalism to the ground are now turned against the bourgeoisie itself
but not only has the bourgeoisie forged the weapons that bring death to itself it has also called into existence the men who are to wield those weapons—the modern working class—the proletarians
in proportion as the bourgeoisie ie capital is developed in the same proportion is the proletariat the modern working class developed a class of laborers who live only so long as they find work and who find work only so long as their labor increases capital these laborers who must sell themselves piecemeal are a commodity like every other article of commerce and are consequently exposed to all the vicissitudes of competition to all the fluctuations of the market
owing to the extensive use of machinery and to division of labor the work of the proletarians has lost all individual character and consequently all charm for the workman he becomes an appendage of the machine and it is only the most simple most monotonous and most easily acquired knack that is required of him hence the cost of production of a workman is restricted almost entirely to the means of subsistence that he requires for his maintenance and for the propagation of his race but the price of a commodity and therefore also of labor is equal in the long run to its cost of production in proportion therefore as the repulsiveness of the work increases the wage decreases nay more in proportion as the use of machinery and division of labor increase in the same proportion the burden of toil also increases whether by prolongation of the working hours by increase of the work exacted in a given time or by increased speed of the machinery etc
modern industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist masses of laborers crowded into the factory are organized like soldiers as privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class and of the bourgeois state they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine by the over-seer and above all by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself the more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim the more petty the more hateful and the more embittering it is
the less skill and exertion of strength is implied in manual labor in other words the more modern industry becomes developed the more is the labor of men superseded by that of women differences of age and sex have no longer any distinctive social validity for the working class all are instruments of labor more or less expensive to use according to age and sex
no sooner is the exploitation of the laborer by the manufacturer so far at an end that he receives his wages in cash than he is set upon by the other portions of the bourgeoisie the landlord the shopkeeper the pawnbroker etc
the lower strata of the middle class—the small trades-people shopkeepers and retired tradesmen generally the handicraftsmen and peasants—all these sink gradually into the proletariat partly because their diminutive capital does not suffice for the scale on which modern industry is carried on and is swamped in the competition with the large capitalists partly because their specialized skill is rendered worthless by new methods of production thus the proletariat is recruited from all classes of the population
the proletariat goes through various stages of development with its birth begins its struggle with the bourgeoisie at first the contest is carried on by individual laborers then by the workpeople of a factory then by the operatives of one trade in one locality against the individual bourgeois who directly exploits them they direct their attacks not against the bourgeois conditions of production but against the instruments of production themselves they destroy imported wares that compete with their labor they smash to pieces machinery they set factories ablaze they seek to restore by force the vanished status of the workman of the middle ages
at this stage the laborers still form an incoherent mass scattered over the whole country and broken up by their mutual competition if anywhere they unite to form more compact bodies this is not yet the consequence of their own active union but of the union of the bourgeoisie which class in order to attain its own political ends is compelled to set the whole proletariat in motion and is moreover yet for a time able to do so at this stage therefore the proletarians do not fight their enemies but the enemies of their enemies the remnants of absolute monarchy and land owners the non-industrial bourgeois the petty bourgeoisie thus the whole historical movement is concentrated in the hands of the bourgeoisie every victory so obtained is a victory for the bourgeoisie
but with the development of industry the proletariat not only increases in number it becomes concentrated in greater masses its strength grows and it feels that strength more the various interests and conditions of life within the ranks of the proletariat are more and more equalized in proportion as machinery obliterates all distinctions of labor and nearly everywhere reduces wages to the same low level the growing competition among the bourgeois and the resulting commercial crises make the wages of the workers ever more fluctuating the unceasing improvement of machinery ever more rapidly developing makes their livelihood more and more precarious the collisions between individual workman and individual bourgeois take more and more the character of collisions between two classes thereupon the workers begin to form combinations (trades unions) against the bourgeois they club together in order to keep up the rate of wages they found permanent associations in order to make provision beforehand for these occasional revolts here and there the contest breaks out into riots
now and then the workers are victorious but only for a time the real fruit of their battles lies not in the immediate result but in the ever improved means of communication that are created in modern industry and that place the workers of different localities in contact with one another it was just this contact that was needed to centralize the numerous local struggles all of the same character into one national struggle between classes but every class struggle is a political struggle and that union to attain which the burghers of the middle ages with their miserable highways required centuries the modern proletarians thanks to railways achieve in a few years
this organization of the proletarians into a class and consequently into a political party is continually being upset again by the competition between the workers themselves but it ever rises up again stronger firmer mightier it compels legislative recognition of particular interests of the workers by taking advantage of the divisions among the bourgeoisie itself thus the ten-hours bill in england was carried
altogether collisions between the classes of the old society further in many ways the course of the development of the proletariat the bourgeoisie finds itself involved in a constant battle at first with the aristocracy later on with those portions of the bourgeoisie itself whose interests have become antagonistic to the progress of industry at all times with the bourgeoisie of foreign countries in all these countries it sees itself compelled to appeal to the proletariat to ask for its help and thus to drag it into the political arena the bourgeoisie itself therefore supplies the proletariat with weapons for fighting the bourgeoisie
further as we have already seen entire sections of the ruling classes are by the advance of industry precipitated into the proletariat or are at least threatened in their conditions of existence these also supply the proletariat with fresh elements of enlightenment and progress
finally in times when the class struggle nears the decisive hour the process of dissolution going on within the ruling class in fact within the whole range of old society assumes such a violent glaring character that a small section of the ruling class cuts itself adrift and joins the revolutionary class the class that holds the future in its hands just as therefore at an earlier period a section of the nobility went over to the bourgeoisie so now a portion of the bourgeoisie goes over to the proletariat and in particular a portion of the bourgeois ideologists who have raised themselves to the level of comprehending theoretically the historical movement as a whole
of all the classes that stand face to face with the bourgeoisie to-day the proletariat alone is a really revolutionary class the other classes decay and finally disappear in the face of modern industry the proletariat is its special and essential product
the lower middle class the small manufacturer the shopkeeper the artisan the peasant all these fight against the bourgeoisie to save from extinction their existence as fractions of the middle class they are therefore not revolutionary but conservative nay more they are reactionary for they try to roll back the wheel of history if by chance they are revolutionary they are so only in view of their impending transfer into the proletariat they thus defend not their present but their future interests they desert their own standpoint to place themselves at that of the proletariat
the dangerous class the social scum that passively rotting class thrown off by the lowest layers of old society may here and there be swept into the movement by a proletarian revolution its conditions of life however prepare it far more for the part of a bribed tool of reactionary intrigue
in the conditions of the proletariat those of old society at large are already virtually swamped the proletarian is without property his relation to his wife and children has no longer anything in common with the bourgeois family relations modern industrial labor modern subjection to capital the same in england as in france in america as in germany has stripped him of every trace of national character law morality religion are to him so many bourgeois prejudices behind which lurk in ambush just as many bourgeois interests
all the preceding classes that got the upper hand sought to fortify their already acquired status by subjecting society at large to their conditions of appropriation the proletarians cannot become masters of the productive forces of society except by abolishing their own previous mode of appropriation and thereby also every other previous mode of appropriation they have nothing of their own to secure and to fortify their mission is to destroy all previous securities for and insurances of individual property
all previous historical movements were movements of minorities or in the interest of minorities the proletarian movement is the self-conscious independent movement of the immense majority in the interest of the immense majority the proletariat the lowest stratum of our present society cannot stir cannot raise itself up without the whole super-incumbent strata of official society being sprung into the air
though not in substance yet in form the struggle of the proletariat with the bourgeoisie is at first a national struggle the proletariat of each country must of course first of all settle matters with its own bourgeoisie
in depicting the most general phases of the development of the proletariat we traced the more or less veiled civil war raging within existing society up to the point where that war breaks out into open revolution and where the violent overthrow of the bourgeoisie lays the foundation for the sway of the proletariat
hitherto every form of society has been based as we have already seen on the antagonism of oppressing and oppressed classes but in order to oppress a class certain conditions must be assured to it under which it can at least continue its slavish existence the serf in the period of serfdom raised himself to membership in the commune just as the petty bourgeois under the yoke of feudal absolutism managed to develop into a bourgeois the modern laborer on the contrary instead of rising with the progress of industry sinks deeper and deeper below the conditions of existence of his own class he becomes a pauper and pauperism develops more rapidly than population and wealth and here it becomes evident that the bourgeoisie is unfit any longer to be the ruling class in society and to impose its conditions of existence upon society as an over-riding law it is unfit to rule because it is incompetent to assure an existence to its slave within his slavery because it cannot help letting him sink into such a state that it has to feed him instead of being fed by him society can no longer live under this bourgeoisie in other words its existence is no longer compatible with society
the essential condition for the existence and for the sway of the bourgeois class is the formation and augmentation of capital the condition for capital is wage-labor wage-labor rests exclusively on competition between the laborers the advance of industry whose involuntary promoter is the bourgeoisie replaces the isolation of the laborers due to competition by their revolutionary combination due to association the development of modern industry therefore cuts from under its feet the very foundation on which the bourgeoisie produces and appropriates products what the bourgeoisie therefore produces above all are its own grave diggers its fall and the victory of the proletariat are equally inevitable
by bourgeoisie is meant the class of modern capitalists owners of the means of social production and employers of wage-labor by proletariat the class of modern wage-laborers who having no means of production of their own are reduced to selling their labor-power in order to live
that is all written history in 1847 the pre-history of society the social organization existing previous to recorded history was all but unknown since then haxthausen discovered common ownership of land in russia maurer proved it to be the social foundation from which all teutonic races started in history and by and by village communities were found to be or to have been the primitive form of society everywhere from india to ireland the inner organization of this primitive communistic society was laid bare in its typical form by morgans crowning discovery of the true nature of the gens and its relation to the tribe with the dissolution of these primaeval communities society begins to be differentiated into separate and finally antagonistic classes i have attempted to retrace this process of dissolution in der ursprung der familie des privateigenthums und des staats 2nd edit stuttgart 1886

commune was the name taken in france by the nascent towns even before they had conquered from their feudal lords and masters local self-government and political rights as the third estate generally speaking for the economical development of the bourgeoisie england is here taken as the typical country for its political development france


in what relation do the communists stand to the proletarians as a whole
the communists do not form a separate party opposed to other working class parties
they have no interests separate and apart from those of the proletariat as a whole
they do not set up any sectarian principles of their own by which to shape and mould the proletarian movement
the communists are distinguished from the other working class parties by this only 1 in the national struggles of the proletarians of the different countries they point out and bring to the front the common interests of the entire proletariat independently of all nationality 2 in the various stages of development which the struggle of the working class against the bourgeoisie has to pass through they always and everywhere represent the interests of the movement as a whole
the communists therefore are on the one hand practically the most advanced and resolute section of the working class parties of every country that section which pushes forward all others on the other hand theoretically they have over the great mass of the proletariat the advantage of clearly understanding the line of march the conditions and the ultimate general results of the proletarian movement
the immediate aim of the communists is the same as that of all the other proletarian parties formation of the proletariat into a class overthrow of the bourgeois supremacy conquest of political power by the proletariat
the theoretical conclusions of the communists are in no way based on ideas or principles that have been invented or discovered by this or that would-be universal reformer
they merely express in general terms actual relations springing from an existing class struggle from a historical movement going on under our very eyes the abolition of existing property relations is not at all a distinctive feature of communism
all property relations in the past have continually been subject to historical change consequent upon the change in historical conditions
the french revolution for example abolished feudal property in favor of bourgeois property
the distinguishing feature of communism is not the abolition of property generally but the abolition of bourgeois property but modern bourgeois private property is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products that is based on class antagonisms on the exploitation of the many by the few
in this sense the theory of the communists may be summed up in the single sentence abolition of private property
we communists have been reproached with the desire of abolishing the right of personally acquiring property as the fruit of a mans own labor which property is alleged to be the ground work of all personal freedom activity and independence
hard-won self-acquired self-earned property do you mean the property of the petty artisan and of the small peasant a form of property that preceded the bourgeois form there is no need to abolish that the development of industry has to a great extent already destroyed it and is still destroying it daily
or do you mean modern bourgeois private property
but does wage labor create any property for the laborer not a bit it creates capital ie that kind of property which exploits wage-labor and which cannot increase except upon condition of begetting a new supply of wage-labor for fresh exploitation property in its present form is based on the antagonism of capital and wage labor let us examine both sides of this antagonism
to be a capitalist is to have not only a purely personal but a social status in production capital is a collective product and only by the united action of many members nay in the last resort only by the united action of all members of society can it be set in motion
capital is therefore not a personal it is a social power
when therefore capital is converted into common property into the property of all members of society personal property is not thereby transformed into social property it is only the social character of the property that is changed it loses its class character
let us now take wage-labor
the average price of wage-labor is the minimum wage ie that quantum of the means of subsistence which is absolutely requisite to keep the laborer in bare existence as a laborer what therefore the wage-laborer appropriates by means of his labor merely suffices to prolong and reproduce a bare existence we by no means intend to abolish this personal appropriation of the products of labor an appropriation that is made for the maintenance and reproduction of human life and that leaves no surplus wherewith to command the labor of others all that we want to do away with is the miserable character of this appropriation under which the laborer lives merely to increase capital and is allowed to live only in so far as the interest of the ruling class requires it
in bourgeois society living labor is but a means to increase accumulated labor in communist society accumulated labor is but a means to widen to enrich to promote the existence of the laborer
in bourgeois society therefore the past dominates the present in communist society the present dominates the past in bourgeois society capital is independent and has individuality while the living person is dependent and has no individuality
and the abolition of this state of things is called by the bourgeois abolition of individuality and freedom and rightly so the abolition of bourgeois individuality bourgeois independence and bourgeois freedom is undoubtedly aimed at
by freedom is meant under the present bourgeois conditions of production free trade free selling and buying
but if selling and buying disappears free selling and buying disappears also this talk about free selling and buying and all the other brave words of our bourgeoisie about freedom in general have a meaning if any only in contrast with restricted selling and buying with the fettered traders of the middle ages but have no meaning when opposed to the communistic abolition of buying and selling of the bourgeois conditions of production and of the bourgeoisie itself
you are horrified at our intending to do away with private property but in your existing society private property is already done away with for nine-tenths of the population its existence for the few is solely due to its non-existence in the hands of those nine-tenths you reproach us therefore with intending to do away with a form of property the necessary condition for whose existence is the non-existence of any property for the immense majority of society
in one word you reproach us with intending to do away with your property precisely so that is just what we intend
from the moment when labor can no longer be converted into capital money or rent into a social power capable of being monopolized ie from the moment when individual property can no longer be transformed into bourgeois property into capital from that moment you say individuality vanishes
you must therefore confess that by individual you mean no other person than the bourgeois than the middle class owner of property this person must indeed be swept out of the way and made impossible
communism deprives no man of the power to appropriate the products of society all that it does is to deprive him of the power to subjugate the labor of others by means of such appropriation
it has been objected that upon the abolition of private property all work will cease and universal laziness will overtake us
according to this bourgeois society ought long ago to have gone to the dogs through sheer idleness for those of its members who work acquire nothing and those who acquire anything do not work the whole of this objection is but another expression of tautology that there can no longer be any wage-labor when there is no longer any capital
all objections against the communistic mode of producing and appropriating material products have in the same way been urged against the communistic modes of producing and appropriating intellectual products just as to the bourgeois the disappearance of class property is the disappearance of production itself so the disappearance of class culture is to him identical with the disappearance of all culture
that culture the loss of which he laments is for the enormous majority a mere training to act as a machine
but dont wrangle with us so long as you apply to our intended abolition of bourgeois property the standard of your bourgeois notions of freedom culture law etc your very ideas are but the outgrowth of the conditions of your bourgeois production and bourgeois property just as your jurisprudence is but the will of your class made into a law for all a will whose essential character and direction are determined by the economical conditions of existence of your class
the selfish misconception that induces you to transform into eternal laws of nature and of reason the social forms springing from your present mode of production and form of property—historical relations that rise and disappear in the progress of production—the misconception you share with every ruling class that has preceded you what you see clearly in the case of ancient property what you admit in the case of feudal property you are of course forbidden to admit in the case of your own bourgeois form of property
abolition of the family even the most radical flare up at this infamous proposal of the communists
on what foundation is the present family the bourgeois family based on capital on private gain in its completely developed form this family exists only among the bourgeoisie but this state of things finds its complement in the practical absence of the family among the proletarians and in public prostitution
the bourgeois family will vanish as a matter of course when its complement vanishes and both will vanish with the vanishing of capital
do you charge us with wanting to stop the exploitation of children by their parents to this crime we plead guilty
but you will say we destroy the most hallowed of relations when we replace home education by social
and your education is not that also social and determined by the social conditions under which you educate by the intervention direct or indirect of society by means of schools etc the communists have not invented the intervention of society in education they do but seek to alter the character of that intervention and to rescue education from the influence of the ruling class
the bourgeois clap-trap about the family and education about the hallowed co-relation of parent and child become all the more disgusting as by the action of modern industry all family ties among the proletarians are torn asunder and their children transformed into simple articles of commerce and instruments of labor
but you communists would introduce community of women screams the whole bourgeoisie in chorus
the bourgeois sees in his wife a mere instrument of production he hears that the instruments of production are to be exploited in common and naturally can come to no other conclusion than that the lot of being common to all will likewise fall to the women
he has not even a suspicion that the real point aimed at is to do away with the status of women as mere instruments of production
for the rest nothing is more ridiculous than the virtuous indignation of our bourgeois at the community of women which they pretend is to be openly and officially established by the communists the communists have no need to introduce community of women it has existed almost from time immemorial
our bourgeois not content with having the wives and daughters of their proletarians at their disposal not to speak of common prostitutes take the greatest pleasure in seducing each others wives
bourgeois marriage is in reality a system of wives in common and thus at the most what the communists might possibly be reproached with is that they desire to introduce in substitution for a hypocritically concealed an openly legalized community of women for the rest it is self-evident that the abolition of the present system of production must bring with it the abolition of the community of women springing from that system ie of prostitution both public and private
the communists are further reproached with desiring to abolish countries and nationality
the workingmen have no country we cannot take from them what they have not got since the proletariat must first of all acquire political supremacy must rise to be the leading class of the nation must constitute itself the nation it is so far itself national though not in the bourgeois sense of the word
national differences and antagonisms between peoples are daily more and more vanishing owing to the development of the bourgeoisie to freedom of commerce to the worlds market to uniformity in the mode of production and in the conditions of life corresponding thereto
the supremacy of the proletariat will cause them to vanish still faster united action of the leading civilized countries at least is one of the first conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat
in proportion as the exploitation of one individual by another is put an end to the exploitation of one nation by another will also be put an end to in proportion as the antagonism between classes within the nation vanishes the hostility of one nation to another will come to an end
the charges against communism made from a religious a philosophical and generally from an ideological standpoint are not deserving of serious examination
does it require deep intuition to comprehend that mans ideas views and conceptions in one word mans consciousness changes with every change in the conditions of his material existence in his social relations and in his social life
what else does the history of ideas prove than that intellectual production changes its character in proportion as material production is changed the ruling ideas of each age have ever been the ideas of its ruling class
when people speak of ideas that revolutionize society they do but express the fact that within the old society the elements of a new one have been created and that the dissolution of the old ideas keeps even pace with the dissolution of the old conditions of existence
when the ancient world was in its last throes the ancient religions were overcome by christianity when christian ideas succumbed in the eighteenth century to rationalist ideas feudal society fought its death battle with the then revolutionary bourgeoisie the ideas of religious liberty and freedom of conscience merely gave expression to the sway of free competition within the domain of knowledge
undoubtedly it will be said religious moral philosophical and juridical ideas have been modified in the course of historical development but religion morality philosophy political science and law constantly survived this change
there are besides eternal truths such as freedom justice etc that are common to all states of society but communism abolishes eternal truths it abolishes all religion and all morality instead of constituting them on a new basis it therefore acts in contradiction to all past historical experience
what does this accusation reduce itself to the history of all past society has consisted in the development of class antagonisms antagonisms that assumed different forms at different epochs
but whatever form they may have taken one fact is common to all past ages viz they exploitation of one part of society by the other no wonder then that the social consciousness of past ages despite all the multiplicity and variety it displays moves within certain common forms or general ideas which cannot completely vanish except with the total disappearance of class antagonisms
the communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations no wonder that its development involves the most radical rupture with traditional ideas
but let us have done with the bourgeois objections to communism
we have seen above that the first step in the revolution by the working class is to raise the proletariat to the position of the ruling class to win the battle of democracy
the proletariat will use its political supremacy to wrest by degrees all capital from the bourgeoisie to centralize all instruments of production in the hands of the state ie of the proletariat organized as the ruling class and to increase the total of productive forces as rapidly as possible
of course in the beginning this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property and on the conditions of bourgeois production by means of measures therefore which appear economically insufficient and untenable but which in the course of the movement outstrip themselves necessitate further inroads upon the old social order and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionizing the mode of production
these measures will of course be different in different countries
nevertheless in the most advanced countries the following will be pretty generally applicable
1 abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes
2 a heavy progressive or graduated income tax
3 abolition of all right of inheritance
4 confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels
5 centralization of credit in the hands of the state by means of a national bank with state capital and an exclusive monopoly
6 centralization of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the state
7 extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the state the bringing into cultivation of waste lands and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan
8 equal liability of all to labor establishment of industrial armies especially for agriculture
9 combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries gradual abolition of the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the population over the country
10 free education for all children in public schools abolition of childrens factory labor in its present form combination of education with industrial production etc etc
when in the course of development class distinctions have disappeared and all production has been concentrated in the hands of a vast association of the whole nation the public power will lose its political character political power properly so called is merely the organized power of one class for oppressing another if the proletariat during its contest with the bourgeoisie is compelled by the force of circumstances to organize itself as a class if by means of a revolution it makes itself the ruling class and as such sweeps away by force the old conditions of production then it will along with these conditions have swept away the conditions for the existence of class antagonisms and of classes generally and will thereby have abolished its own supremacy as a class
in place of the old bourgeois society with its classes and class antagonisms we shall have an association in which the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all

feudal socialism
owing to their historical position it became the vocation of the aristocracies of france and england to write pamphlets against modern bourgeois society in the french revolution of july 1830 and in the english reform agitation these aristocracies again succumbed to the hateful upstart thenceforth a serious political contest was altogether out of question a literary battle alone remained possible but even in the domain of literature the old cries of the restoration period had become impossible
in order to arouse sympathy the aristocracy were obliged to lose sight apparently of their own interests and to formulate their indictment against the bourgeoisie in the interest of the exploited working class alone thus the aristocracy took their revenge by singing lampoons on their new master and whispering in his ears sinister prophecies of coming catastrophe
in this way arose feudal socialism half lamentation half lampoon half echo of the past half menace of the future at times by its bitter witty and incisive criticism striking the bourgeoisie to the very hearts core but always ludicrous in its effects through total incapacity to comprehend the march of modern history
the aristocracy in order to rally the people to them waved the proletarian alms-bag in front for a banner but the people so often as it joined them saw on their hindquarters the old feudal coats of arms and deserted with loud and irreverent laughter
one section of the french legitimists and young england exhibited this spectacle
in pointing out that their mode of exploitation was different from that of the bourgeoisie the feudalists forget that they exploited under circumstances and conditions that were quite different and that are now antiquated in showing that under their rule the modern proletariat never existed they forget that the modern bourgeoisie is the necessary offspring of their own form of society
for the rest so little do they conceal the reactionary character of their criticism that their chief accusation against the bourgeoisie amounts to this that under the bourgeois regime a class is being developed which is destined to cut up root and branch the old order of society
what they upbraid the bourgeoisie with is not so much that it creates a proletariat as that it creates a revolutionary proletariat
in political practice therefore they join in all coercive measures against the working class and in ordinary life despite their high falutin phrases they stoop to pick up the golden apples dropped from the tree of industry and to barter truth love and honor for traffic in wool beet-root sugar and potato spirit
as the parson has ever gone hand in hand with the landlord so has clerical socialism with feudal socialism
nothing is easier than to give christian asceticism a socialist tinge has not christianity declaimed against private property against marriages against the state has it not preached in the place of these charity and poverty celibacy and mortification of the flesh monastic life and mother church christian socialism is but the holy water with which the priest consecrates the heart-burnings of the aristocrat
petty bourgeois socialism
the feudal aristocracy was not the only class that was ruined by the bourgeoisie not the only class whose conditions of existence pined and perished in the atmosphere of modern bourgeois society the medieval burgesses and the small peasant proprietors were the precursors of the modern bourgeoisie in those countries which are but little developed industrially and commercially these two classes still vegetate side by side with the rising bourgeoisie
in countries where modern civilization has become fully developed a new class of petty bourgeois has been formed fluctuating between proletariat and bourgeoisie and ever renewing itself as a supplementary part of bourgeois society the individual members of this class however are being constantly hurled down into the proletariat by the action of competition and as modern industry develops they even see the moment approaching when they will completely disappear as an independent section of modern society to be replaced in manufactures agriculture and commerce by overlookers bailiffs and shopmen
in countries like france where the peasants constitute far more than half of the population it was natural that writers who sided with the proletariat against the bourgeoisie should use in their criticism of the bourgeois regime the standard of the peasant and petty bourgeois and from the standpoint of these intermediate classes should take up the cudgels for the working class thus arose petty bourgeois socialism sismondi was the head of this school not only in france but also in england
this school of socialism dissected with great acuteness the contradictions in the conditions of modern production it laid bare the hypocritical apologies of economists it proved incontrovertibly the disastrous effects of machinery and division of labor the concentration of capital and land in a few hands overproduction and crises it pointed out the inevitable ruin of the petty bourgeois and peasant the misery of the proletariat the anarchy in production the crying inequalities in the distribution of wealth the industrial war of extermination between nations the dissolution of old moral bonds of the old family relations of the old nationalities
in its positive aims however this form of socialism aspires either to restoring the old means of production and of exchange and with them the old property relations and the old society or to cramping the modern means of production and of exchange within the frame work of the old property relations that have been and were bound to be exploded by those means in either case it is both reactionary and utopian
its last words are corporate guilds for manufacture patriarchal relations in agriculture
ultimately when stubborn historical facts had dispersed all intoxicating effects of self-deception this form of socialism ended in a miserable fit of the blues
german or true socialism
the socialist and communist literature of france a literature that originated under the pressure of a bourgeoisie in power and that was the expression of the struggle against this power was introduced into germany at a time when the bourgeoisie in that country had just begun its contest with feudal absolutism
german philosophers—would-be philosophers and beaux esprits—eagerly seized on this literature only forgetting that when these writings immigrated from france into germany french social conditions had not immigrated along with them in contact with german social conditions this french literature lost all its immediate practical significance and assumed a purely literary aspect thus to the german philosophers of the eighteenth century the demands of the first french revolution were nothing more than the demands of practical reason in general and the utterances of the will of the revolutionary french bourgeoisie signified in their eyes the laws of pure will of will as it was bound to be of true human will generally
the work of the german literati consisted solely in bringing the new french ideas into harmony with their ancient philosophical conscience or rather in annexing the french ideas without deserting their own philosophic point of view
this annexation took place in the same way in which a foreign language is appropriated namely by translation
it is well known how the monks wrote silly lives of catholic saints over the manuscripts on which the classical works of ancient heathendom had been written the german literati reversed this process with the profane french literature they wrote their philosophical nonsense beneath the french original for instance beneath the french criticism of the economic functions of money they wrote alienation of humanity and beneath the french criticism of the bourgeois state they wrote dethronement of the category of the general and so forth
the introduction of these philosophical phrases at the back of the french historical criticisms they dubbed philosophy of action true socialism german science of socialism philosophical foundation of socialism and so on
the french socialist and communist literature was thus completely emasculated and since it ceased in the hands of the german to express the struggle of one class with the other he felt conscious of having overcome french one-sidedness and of representing not true requirements but the requirements of truth not the interests of the proletariat but the interests of human nature of man in general who belongs to no class has no reality and exists only in the misty realm of philosophical phantasy
this german socialism which took its school-boy task so seriously and solemnly and extolled its poor stock in trade in such mountebank fashion meanwhile gradually lost its pedantic innocence
the fight of the german and especially of the prussian bourgeoisie against feudal aristocracy and absolute monarchy in other words the liberal movement became more earnest
by this the long wished-for opportunity was offered to true socialism of confronting the political movement with the socialist demands of hurling the traditional anathemas against liberalism against representative government against bourgeois competition bourgeois freedom of the press bourgeois legislation bourgeois liberty and equality and of preaching to the masses that they had nothing to gain and everything to lose by this bourgeois movement german socialism forgot in the nick of time that the french criticism whose silly echo it was presupposed the existence of modern bourgeois society with its corresponding economic conditions of existence and the political constitution adapted thereto the very things whose attainment was the object of the pending struggle in germany
to the absolute governments with their following of parsons professors country squires and officials it served as a welcome scarecrow against the threatening bourgeoisie
it was a sweet finish after the bitter pills of floggings and bullets with which these same governments just at that time dosed the german working-class risings
while this true socialism thus served the government as a weapon for fighting the german bourgeoisie it at the same time directly represented a reactionary interest the interest of the german philistines in germany the petty bourgeois class a relique of the 16th century and since then constantly cropping up again under various forms is the real social basis of the existing state of things
to preserve this class is to preserve the existing state of things in germany the industrial and political supremacy of the bourgeoisie threatens it with certain destruction on the one hand from the concentration of capital on the other from the rise of a revolutionary proletariat true socialism appeared to kill these two birds with one stone it spread like an epidemic
the robe of speculative cobwebs embroidered with flowers of rhetoric steeped in the dew of sickly sentiment this transcendental robe in which the german socialists wrapped their sorry eternal truths all skin and bone served to wonderfully increase the sale of their goods amongst such a public
and on its part german socialism recognized more and more its own calling as the bombastic representative of the petty bourgeois philistine
it proclaimed the german nation to be the model nation and the german petty philistine to be the typical man to every villainous meanness of this model man it gave a hidden higher socialistic interpretation the exact contrary of its real character it went to the extreme length of directly opposing the brutally destructive tendency of communism and of proclaiming its supreme and impartial contempt of all class-struggles with very few exceptions all the so-called socialist and communist publications that now (1847) circulate in germany belong to the domain of this foul and enervating literature

a part of the bourgeoisie is desirous of redressing social grievances in order to secure the continued existence of bourgeois society
to this section belong economists philanthropists humanitarians improvers of the condition of the working class organizers of charity members of societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals temperance fanatics hole and corner reformers of every imaginable kind this form of socialism has moreover been worked out into complete systems
we may cite proudhons philosophie de la misère as an example of this form
the socialistic bourgeois want all the advantages of modern social conditions without the struggles and dangers necessarily resulting therefrom they desire the existing state of society minus its revolutionary and disintegrating elements they wish for a bourgeoisie without a proletariat the bourgeoisie naturally conceives the world in which it is supreme to be the best and bourgeois socialism develops this comfortable conception into various more or less complete systems in requiring the proletariat to carry out such a system and thereby to march straightway into the social new jerusalem it but requires in reality that the proletariat should remain within the bounds of existing society but should cast away all its hateful ideas concerning the bourgeosie
a second and more practical but less systematic form of this socialism sought to depreciate every revolutionary movement in the eyes of the working class by showing that no mere political reform but a change in the material conditions of existence in economical relations could be of any advantage to them by changes in the material conditions of existence this form of socialism however by no means understands abolition of the bourgeois relations of production—an abolition that can be effected only by a revolution—but administrative reforms based on the continued existence of these relations reforms therefore that in no respect affect the relations between capital and labor but at the best lessen the cost and simplify the administrative work of bourgeois government
bourgeois socialism attains adequate expression when and only when it becomes a mere figure of speech
free trade for the benefit of the working class protective duties for the benefit of the working class prison reform for the benefit of the working class this is the last word and the only seriously meant word of bourgeois socialism
it is summed up in the phrase the bourgeois is a bourgeois—for the benefit of the working class

we do not here refer to that literature which in every great modern revolution has always given voice to the demands of the proletariat such as the writings of baboeuf and others
the first direct attempts of the proletariat to attain its own ends made in times of universal excitement when feudal society was being overthrown these attempts necessarily failed owing to the then undeveloped state of the proletariat as well as to the absence of the economic conditions for its emancipation conditions that had yet to be produced and could be produced by the impending bourgeois epoch alone the revolutionary literature that accompanied these first movements of the proletariat had necessarily a reactionary character it inculcated universal asceticism and social levelling in its crudest form
the socialist and communist systems properly so called those of st simon fourier owen and others spring into existence in the early undeveloped period described above of the struggle between proletariat and bourgeoisie (see bourgeoisie and proletariat)
the founders of these systems see indeed the class antagonisms as well as the action of the decomposing elements in the prevailing form of society but the proletariat as yet in its infancy offers to them the spectacle of a class without any historical initiative or any independent political movement
since the development of class antagonism keeps even pace with the development of industry the economic situation as they find it does not as yet offer to them the material conditions for the emancipation of the proletariat they therefore search after a new social science after new social laws that are to create these conditions
historical action is to yield to their personal inventive action historically created conditions of emancipation to phantastic ones and the gradual spontaneous class organization of the proletariat to an organization of society specially contrived by these inventors future history resolves itself in their eyes into the propaganda and the practical carrying out of their social plans
in the formation of their plans they are conscious of caring chiefly for the interest of the working class as being the most suffering class only from the point of view of being the most suffering class does the proletariat exist for them
the undeveloped state of the class struggle as well as their own surroundings cause socialists of this kind to consider themselves far superior to all class antagonisms they want to improve the condition of every member of society even that of the most favored hence they habitually appeal to society at large without distinction of class nay by preference to the ruling class for how can people when once they understand their system fail to see in it the best possible plan of the best possible state of society
hence they reject all political and especially all revolutionary action they wish to attain their ends by peaceful means and endeavor by small experiments necessarily doomed to failure and by the force of example to pave the way for the new social gospel
such phantastic pictures of future society painted at a time when the proletariat is still in a very undeveloped state and has but a phantastic conception of its own position correspond with the first instinctive yearnings of that class for a general reconstruction of society
but these socialist and communist publications contain also a critical element they attack every principle of existing society hence they are full of the most valuable materials for the enlightenment of the working class the practical measures proposed in them such as the abolition of the distinction between town and country of the family of the carrying on of industries for the account of private individuals and of the wage system the proclamation of social harmony the conversion of the functions of the state into a mere superintendence of production all these proposals point solely to the disappearance of class antagonisms which were at that time only just cropping up and which in these publications are recognized under their earliest indistinct and undefined forms only these proposals therefore are of a purely utopian character
the significance of critical-utopian socialism and communism bears an inverse relation to historical development in proportion as the modern class struggle develops and takes definite shape this phantastic standing apart from the contest these phantastic attacks on it lose all practical value and all theoretical justification therefore although the originators of these systems were in many respects revolutionary their disciples have in every case formed mere reactionary sects they hold fast by the original views of their masters in opposition to the progressive historical development of the proletariat they therefore endeavor and that consistently to deaden the class struggle and to reconcile the class antagonisms they still dream of experimental realization of their social utopias of founding isolated phalansteres of establishing home colonies of setting up a little icaria—duodecimo editions of the new jerusalem and to realize all these castles in the air they are compelled to appeal to the feelings and purses of the bourgeois by degrees they sink into the category of the reactionary conservative socialists depicted above differing from these only by more systematic pedantry and by their fanatical and superstitious belief in the miraculous effects of their social science
they therefore violently oppose all political action on the part of the working class such action according to them can only result from blind unbelief in the new gospel
the owenites in england and the fourierists in france respectively oppose the chartists and the réformistes
not the english restoration 1660 to 1689 but the french restoration 1814 to 1830
this applies chiefly to germany where the landed aristocracy and squirearchy have large portions of their estates cultivated for their own account by stewards and are moreover extensive beet-root sugar manufacturers and distillers of potato spirits the wealthier british aristocracy are as yet rather above that but they too know how to make up for declining rents by lending their names to floaters of more or less shady joint-stock companies
phalansteres were socialist colonies on the plan of charles fourier icaria was the name given by cabet to his utopia and later on to his american communist colony



has made clear the relations of the communists to the existing working class parties such as the chartists in england and the agrarian reformers in america
the communists fight for the attainment of the immediate aims for the enforcement of the momentary interests of the working class but in the movement of the present they also represent and take care of the future of that movement in france the communists ally themselves with the social-democrats against the conservative and radical bourgeoisie reserving however the right to take up a critical position in regard to phrases and illusions traditionally handed down from the great revolution
in switzerland they support the radicals without losing sight of the fact that this party consists of antagonistic elements partly of democratic socialists in the french sense partly of radical bourgeois
in poland they support the party that insists on an agrarian revolution as the prime condition for national emancipation that party which fomented the insurrection of cracow in 1846
in germany they fight with the bourgeoisie whenever it acts in a revolutionary way against the absolute monarchy the feudal squirearchy and the petty bourgeoisie
but they never cease for a single instant to instil into the working class the clearest possible recognition of the hostile antagonism between bourgeoisie and proletariat in order that the german workers may straightway use as so many weapons against the bourgeoisie the social and political conditions that the bourgeoisie must necessarily introduce along with its supremacy and in order that after the fall of the reactionary classes in germany the fight against the bourgeoisie itself may immediately begin
the communists turn their attention chiefly to germany because that country is on the eve of a bourgeois revolution that is bound to be carried out under more advanced conditions of european civilization and with a much more developed proletariat than that of england was in the seventeenth and of france in the eighteenth century and because the bourgeois revolution in germany will be but the prelude to an immediately following proletarian revolution
in short the communists everywhere support every revolutionary movement against the existing social and political order of things
in all these movements they bring to the front as the leading question in each the property question no matter what its degree of development at the time
finally they labor everywhere for the union and agreement of the democratic parties of all countries
the communists disdain to conceal their views and aims they openly declare that their ends can be attained only by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions let the ruling classes tremble at a communistic revolution the proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains they have a world to win
workingmen of all countries unite
the party then represented in parliament by ledru-rollin in literature by louis blanc in the daily press by the reforme the name of social-democracy signified with these its inventors a section of the democratic or republican party more or less tinged with socialism
